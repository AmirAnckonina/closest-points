Problem:
Given an array of 2 integer arrays representing x,y coordinates, 
write a function that return and calculate the S amount of closest points to origin (0,0). 
For example: [[1,2], [3,5], [-1,1], [,7,9]], if we would want to get the 2 closest points to the origin the output would be: [1,2], [-1,1] 

Solution:
Written in Intellij IDEA IDE
I put my efforts on providing readble and extensible generic solution.
I believe there are more efficient solutions in the aspect of performance, the code is a prepared for other implementations.

Thanks,
